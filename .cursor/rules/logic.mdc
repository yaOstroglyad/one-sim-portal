Project Overview
This project is a portal for managing companies and their clients. It supports multi-level hierarchical logic, meaning:

An admin creates companies under their account. Each company can register its own clients or sub-companies. These sub-companies can then repeat the same process endlessly, forming a recursive structure. The core product is the sale of eSIMs. 

Currently, the main collaborators are tour operators, who:

Define a list of products. Sell those products as part of their tour packages. Additionally, thereâ€™s a basic CRM module used by support staff to view and analyze client-related data.

Modules Overview
Company Management
Create and edit companies at any level of the hierarchy.

Customer Management
Add, edit, and view detailed information about customers.

Provider Integration
Manage providers who supply eSIMs to the platform.

Order Management

Each transaction creates an order.

When the product is resold downstream, a child order is created and linked to the parent.

This creates a traceable order chain, enabling complete visibility into the order flow across all levels.

Product Management

Products are initially created as templates ("blueprints") by the admin.

These templates are passed down the hierarchy.

Companies at lower levels can customize products (rename, set markup prices, etc.).

Inventory Management

eSIM cards from providers are delivered as files.

These files are uploaded via our API into the inventory module, importing the eSIMs into the system.

The inventory is stored at the admin level and then distributed down.

User Management
Basic CRUD operations to create and manage platform users.

Company Settings
Currently limited to configuring payment methods, with more options planned.

Technical Notes
The UI is built primarily with Angular Material and generic-table components.

Forms are dynamically created using a custom app-form-generator.
