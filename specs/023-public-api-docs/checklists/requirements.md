# Specification Quality Checklist: Public API Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items pass validation:

1. **Content Quality**: Spec focuses on user journeys and business value without mentioning specific technologies
2. **Requirements**: All 12 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria in user stories
3. **Success Criteria**: All 6 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
4. **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases identified covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
5. **Scope**: Clear "Out of Scope" section defines boundaries

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - requirements are well-defined from user context
- Infrastructure reuse strategy (search providers, CSS variables) documented in Assumptions
